 * A spatial index used to store point references to geometric elements.

 * An instance of this class is optionally used to speed up spatial querying on
 * huge sets of geographic objects.
 * 
 * XXX This spatial index uses a quadtree implementation (from pherd) that does
 * not accept lines or polygons, only points. So it's not really adapted to
 * complex spatial queries like intersection tests. I think gs-geometry would be
 * better off using another quadtree implementation. Writing one from scratch
 * would be a bit of work but it would be more adapted. Or maybe there are
 * other libraries to achieve this work?
